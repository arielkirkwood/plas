Contributing
------------

We have a GitHub mirror of our private repository set up
at http://github.com/colindean/plas. Github will likely eventually become our
favored repository.

We develop on ruby-head 1.9.3 and rails 3.0.0. See the Gemfile for 
other stuff we require. We do provide an .rvmrc for rvm users (seriously makes life so much easier). 

Colin is currently using ruby 1.9.3dev (2010-08-24 trunk 29084) [x86\_64-darwin10.4.0].

**What we really need are tests.** Colin has not been a good Rubyist and
done proper test-driven development due to the time crunch. We use RSpec and
Cucumber for tests, what few there are.

Assuming you already have git, any ruby, and rvm installed, do these:

    git clone http://github.com/colindean/plas.git
    cd plas
    gem install bundler
    bundle install

That should make your environment kosher. When you `cd` into `plas`, rvm will ask if you want to download, compile, and install ruby-head and create a gemset called `plas`. You should probably say yes, but if you have ruby 1.9.2 installed and in use, you're probably OK. You should create the gemset anyhow.

Hell, it's not ready for our use!
